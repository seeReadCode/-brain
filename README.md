No peeking!

But really, I use this setup for note taking and thinking with [Atom](https://atom.io/).
I've kept the actual content out but am sharing my setup for its
improvement and/or your amusement.

## Setup

I use `asdf` for managing `node` versions.  I run this repo on `v6.3.1` but
I imagine it works on many others.

Assuming you have a reliable `node` setup and [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed (or are a nix user who has read far past this already)...

```bash
npm install
brew install atom
apm install browser-plus@0.0.98 busy-signal@2.0.1 clipboard-plus@0.5.1 \
  date@2.6.0 file-icons@2.1.39 git-plus@8.7.1 hey-pane@1.2.0 \
  highlight-colors@0.9.0 highlight-line@0.12.0 highlight-selected@0.17.0 \
  intentions@1.1.5 link-helper@0.2.0 linkist@1.3.1 lint-scroll-marker@0.3.0 \
  linter@2.3.1 linter-markdown@5.2.11 linter-ui-default@1.8.1 \
  markdown-fold@0.3.0 markdown-image-assistant@0.2.2 \
  markdown-preview-enhanced@0.17.7 markdown-toc@0.4.2 prettier-atom@0.58.2 \
  scroll-marker@0.3.2 tree-view-git-status@1.5.2 wordcount@3.1.0
```
